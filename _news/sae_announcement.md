I'm very proud to announce that I have been selected as a recipient of the [Society of Automotive Engineers Doctoral Engineering Scholarship.](https://www.sae.org/binaries/content/assets/cm/content/participate/scholarships/updated---sae-scholarship-recipients-23-24.pdf) This award recognizes PhD students who have demonstrated a history of academic excellence, leadership skills in community and extracurriciular activities, and plan to pursue a career teaching engineering at the university level.

Coming from a family of educators, the power of a devoted and caring teacher has always been evident. Especially in the engineering field where coursework can be extremely difficult, the role of the educator is crucial in the development of the next generation of scientists and engineers.

I hope that I am able to put this award to good use, and that I will be able to give back to the engineering community through the selfless act of teaching.
