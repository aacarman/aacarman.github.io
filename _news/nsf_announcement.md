I am pleased to announce that I have received an Honorable Mention in the [National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.lubbockonline.com/story/news/education/2021/04/09/texas-tech-grad-students-awarded-national-science-foundations-graduate-research-fellowship/7099899002/). This nationwide program offers 1st and 2nd year graduate students full tuition payments and a stipend to carry out impactful research in fields of interest to the National Science Foundation. Although I was not selected to receive an award, receiving an Honorable Mention during my 1st year of graduate study is certainly an achievement of which I am quite proud.

My research proposal, titled "A MIMO-CW radar to localize and isolate chamber-specific heart characteristics using a novel wavelength division superresolution technique and hybrid beamforming," aims to develop a novel wavelength-division MIMO radar system to isolate the chamber-specific heart characteristics of a human target completely wirelessly. With the prevalence of heart disease in today's modern world, such an innovation would be pivotal in advancing modern medical diagnostics.

I am very excited to continue my research throughout graduate school, and look forward to seeing the impacts my works could have in the world.
