I'm happy to announce that I have been selected as a recipient of the [NXP Foundation Graduate Engineering Fellowship](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/coe/wcoenews/posts/2023/08/aaroncarman.php?v=current) I was selected for this award after being nominated by the Electrical and Computer Engineering department for my strong academic record and research interests in the field of mmWave radar sensors.

I am extremely grateful to the NXP Foundation for their generosity, and am delighted to have been selected for this prestigious award. The NXP Foundation Fellowship will allow me to dedicate more time and energy to impactful research, and motivates me to continue my academic efforts.
