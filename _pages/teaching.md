## [ECE x321: Design of Analog Integrated Circuits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzdx4XTNZ9g&list=PLlW-GQWsAyZAYQTbKD_5ZmaWcY8mZysbI&pp=gAQBiAQB)
These tutorials describe how to connect to a remote server with Cadence Custom IC installed and the fundamental skills needed to develop analog integrated circuits. We begin with DC I-V curve simulations, and move on to amplifier transfer function, stability, and transient simulations using SPECTRE. Finally, we show how to layout an analog IC at the transistor level, and how to use LVS and DRC tools to verify the design's accuracy. Throughout the process, we also learn the Linux commands necessary to navigate the file system and remove Cadence lock files when necessary.

## [ECE x310: Introduction to VLSI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d35xfiOOZc&list=PLlW-GQWsAyZBthLVzDcxdeFDOlMFV2TgA&pp=gAQBiAQB)
These tutorials are the digital complement to the Analog IC tutorials, with a greater focus on digital performance and design. We begin from a schematic level, and move up to layouts, simulation, and verification. 

## [AWR MWO Tutorial](https://youtu.be/yVLRs8t1Lwo?si=2bb_Ra7HysgaHFBi)
This video provides an introduction to Cadence AWR, and how it can be used to perform impedance matching with lumped components and transmission lines.

## [Electronics Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DiUkPxTaio&list=PLlW-GQWsAyZD8TADvgd1mkY56lr_S5l3L&pp=gAQBiAQB)
This video series provides a first look at the fundamentals of electronic devices including op-amps, diodes, BJTs, and MOSFETs. We also look at applications for each, and learn how we can simulate them in the free software LTSpice.

## [Circuit Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24QCX00EfXk&list=PLlW-GQWsAyZDl9IUTCSxESgEAHlvHoDjd&pp=gAQBiAQB)
This video series provides an introduction to circuit analysis. Fundamental topics such as Kirchoff's Laws, combinations of resistors, and circuit solving methods are presented. In addition, AC electronics are examined to find out how they respond to sinusoidal stimulation.
